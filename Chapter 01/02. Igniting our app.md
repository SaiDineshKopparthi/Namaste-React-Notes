## `npm`

- `npm` is everything else but **node package manager**.

## `package.json`

- `package.json` is a configuration file for `npm`. `npm` manages the dependencies of our project. This dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file.

## Installing dependencies into the project.

- The most important dependency in our project is `bundler`

### What is a bundler?

- A bundler packages/bundles your app to ship it to production. **Webpack** is a popular option available in the market.
- **Create React App** uses webpack & babel as bundler/transpiler behind the scenes.
- Other available bundlers include parcel and vite.

### Parcel

- Installing parcel in our project - `npm install parcel`.
- There are two types of dependencies: dev dependencies and normal dependencies (production dependencies).
- `npm -D parcel` - This installs **parcel** as a dev dependency.
- This is because **bundling is usually done in development environment**. We don't need a bundler in production environment.

```json
"devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.13.3"
}
```

## Understanding npm Version Specifiers

### Version Syntax in `package.json`

- **`^2.13.3`** - Caret (`^`) allows **minor and patch** updates automatically

  - Will accept: 2.13.4, 2.14.0, 2.99.99
  - Will reject: 3.0.0 and above
  - Example: If 2.13.4 is released, `npm update` will install it

- **`~2.13.3`** - Tilde (`~`) allows only **patch** updates automatically

  - Will accept: 2.13.4, 2.13.5, 2.13.99
  - Will reject: 2.14.0 and above
  - Example: If 2.13.4 is released, `npm update` will install it

- **`2.13.3`** - Exact version, no updates are allowed
  - Only version 2.13.3 will ever be installed
  - Updates are never automatic, even with `npm update`

The constraint `^2.13.3` gives `npm` permission to update to newer minor and patch versions, but `npm` doesn't actually perform these updates on its own without being told to do so.

You still need to explicitly run `npm update` to trigger the update process. Only then will `npm` look for newer versions that satisfy your constraints and install them.

## Update Behavior

### Using `npm update`

- Updates packages to the latest version allowed by your version constraints
- Only `package-lock.json` is updated to show the actual installed version
- `package.json` keeps the original version range (e.g., `^2.13.3`)

### Using `npm install package@version`

- Explicitly installing a specific version updates both files:
  - `package.json` will show the new version constraint
  - `package-lock.json` will show the exact installed version

### Example

If your `package.json` has `"example-package": "^1.2.3"`:

- Running `npm update` installs version 1.2.4 (if available)
- `package-lock.json` shows `"example-package": "1.2.4"`
- `package.json` remains `"example-package": "^1.2.3"`

If you run `npm install example-package@latest`:

- Both files are updated to the latest version

## `node_modules`

- When we run any installation command, for eg: `npm install parcel`, the package installer fetches the **parcel** code from the production and installs it in the `node_modules` package.
- Also it should be noted that it is not just the code of `parcel` that will be installed, but also the code of its dependencies that will be installed into the `node_modules`. This is known as **transitive dependencies**.
- Every dependency will have it's own `package.json`.
- We should **NEVER** push `node_modules` to the **git repository**.

This may raise a new doubt. What happens when we run our project in a different device, after cloning it from the git repository?

- This is the reason we have `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- We can simply run the command `npm install` and all the dependencies will be installed in the local of that device and a new `node_modules` folder will be available in it.

### <div align='center'>Anything that can be re-generated is need not be published in git</div>

## Bundling the application

- We can start with the command `npx parcel index.html`.
- `npx` executes the packages.
- After removing CDN links from `index.html` and installing `react` and `react-dom`, we need to update the code in `App.js` to use both `react` and `react-dom` from `node_modules`.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const parent = React.createElement("div", { id: "parent" }, [
  React.createElement("div", { id: "child" }, [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "Creating nested HTML elements using React"),
    React.createElement("h2", {}, "Second element"),
  ]),
  React.createElement("div", { id: "child2" }, [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "Creating nested HTML elements using React"),
    React.createElement("h2", {}, "Second element"),
  ]),
]);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(parent);
```

- But this gives error.

```

@parcel/transformer-js: Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports.

üí° Add the type="module" attribute to the <script> tag.

```

- The issue here is that by default, browser scripts are treated as "classic scripts" (non-module scripts) which don't support import/export syntax.
- Modern browsers do support ES modules directly, but you need to explicitly tell the browser to treat your script as a module.
- To overcome this we need to update the `script` tag with the `module` attribute:

```javascript
<script type="module" src="App.js"></script>
```

- Adding type="module" tells both the browser and Parcel to treat the script as an ES module, which:

  - Allows using `import/export` statements
  - Automatically applies strict mode
  - Defers execution (similar to adding the `defer` attribute)

### React DOM is updated after React 18

```javascript
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; //Before (React < 18)
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client"; //After (React 18+)

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
```

### Things parcel is doing

- Development Build
- Local Server
- HMR - Hot Module Replacement
- HMR is done using 'File Watching Algorithm' written in C++.
- Caching - Each and every time we make changes inside the project, build time reduces because of caching.
- Image optimization
- Minification
- Bundling
- Compressing
- Consistent Hashing
- Code Splitting
- Differential Bundling - Supports cross browser bundling.
- Diagnostics
- Error Handling
- Using parser, we can also host our application in HTTPS local server.
- Tree Shaking- remove unused code.

### Production build using Parcel.

- `npx parcel build index.html` - At this current stage running this command will give error.

```
    4 |   "description": "A package created for practising the React course",
  > 5 |   "main": "App.js",
  >   |           ^^^^^^^^ Did you mean "App.html"?
    6 |   "scripts": {
    7 |     "test": "jest"

  üí° Try changing the file extension of "main" in package.json.
```

- In our `package.json` we defined the entry point (main) as `App.js`.
- But when using parser, we defined entry point as `index.html`. So parcel conflicts with that.
- We can remove `"main": "App.js",` from the `package.json`.

- Now when we run the command `npx parcel build index.html`, the app is bundled into production ready code and pushed into the `dist` folder.

### The reason for including `node_modules`, `dist` and `.parcel_cache` in `.gitignore`.

- After we push our code from our local to GitHub repository, we use this repository and clone this code onto a server.
- Now we will run commands like `npx parcel build index.html` and `npm install` on our server.
- This will generate `node_modules`, `dist` and `.parcel_cache` on the server.
- This is the reason why we never push these to our GitHub repository.

### Making our app compatible for multiple browsers

- We use `browser list` for this scenario.
- Now using `browser-list` we need to tell our project, what all browsers our app should work in.
- This needs to be configured inside `package.json`.

```json
"browserslist": [
    "last 2 Chrome versions",
    "last 2 Firefox versions"
]
```

- Specifying this way ensures our app works in last two versions of Chrome and Firefox, but it **may or may not work**, in other versions of these browsers or different browser as well.

```json
"browserslist": [
    "last 2 versions"
]
```

- Ensures it works for last 2 versions of all the browsers.
- `browserslist` have much more wide use cases. They can be explored in their GitHub page.
