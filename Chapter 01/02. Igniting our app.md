## `npm`

- `npm` is everything else but **node package manager**.

## `package.json`

- `package.json` is a configuration for `npm`. `npm` manages the dependencies of our project. This dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file.

## Installing dependencies into the project.

- The most important dependency in our project is `bundler`

### What is a bundler?

- A bundler packages/bundles your app to ship it to production. **Webpack** is a popular option available in the market.
- **Create React App** uses webpack & babel as bundler behind the scenes.
- Other available bundlers include parcel and vite.

### Parcel

- Installing parcel in our project - `npm install parcel`.
- There are two types of dependencies: dev dependencies and normal dependencies (production dependencies).
- `npm -D parcel` - This installs **parcel** as a dev dependency.
- This is because **bundling is usually done in development environment**. We don't need a bundler in production environment.

```json
"devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.13.3"
}
```

- `^2.13.3` - Using caret(`^`) in front of the version number means that, the minor version update are done automatically.
- `~2.13.3` - If there is a tilde(`~`) then major updates are installed automatically.
- `2.13.3` - If there is no caret(`^`) or tilde(`~`), it means that the **parcel** version `2.13.3` will never be updated inside this project.

## `package-lock.json`

- `package-lock.json` keeps a track of exact version of the package that is being installed.

## `node_modules`

- When we run any installation command, for eg: `npm install parcel`, the package installer fetches the **parcel** code from the production and installs it in the `node_modules` package.
- Also it should be noted that it is not just the code of `parcel` that will be installed, but also the code of its dependencies that will be installed into the `node_modules`. This is known as **transitive dependencies**.
- Every dependency will have it's own `package.json`.
- We should **NEVER** push `node_modules` to the **git repository**.

This may raise a new doubt. What happens when we run out project in a different device, after cloning it from the git repository?

- This is the reason we have `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- We can simply run the command `npm install` and all the dependencies will be installed in the local of that device and a new `node_modules` folder will be available in it.
