### Creating a basic web page using HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root">
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

- This is a basic web page that display the heading - **"Hello World!"**
- Most of the boiler plate code for creating this web page can be generated using the **"Emmet"**, `html:5`.

### Creating a basic web page using HTML & JavaScript

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script>
      const heading = document.createElement("h1");
      heading.innerHTML = "Hello World From JavaScript!";

      const root = document.getElementById("root");
      root.appendChild(heading);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

- Now we have created a similar web page, but this the rendering of the heading is done through the **JavaScript**.

### Creating a basic web page using React

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"
    ></script>
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"
    ></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

- `https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js` - Available in this URL is the code of React written in JavaScript (React is a JavaScript library). 
- To get a better peek into the available functionalities, open browser and type `React`.
- `https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js` - While the first URL is core of React, this second URL is library to use React DOM.
- - To get a better peek into the available functionalities, open browser and type `ReactDOM`.
- The reason why there are two separate URLs is because, React is not just used in browsers, it is also used in mobiles and other such notable scenarios. 
- For this reason, React is separated into individual modules, based on the use cases, with the core module in one place.
