## `npm scripts`

- `npx parcel index.html`, this is the command that we have seen before that is used to get the development build.
- Instead of using this command all the time, we can set up `npm script` in `package.json`.
- We can do the same to out production build command, `npx parcel build index.html`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html"
  }
}
```

- Here i'm setting the command for **dev build** as `start` and **prod build** as `build`.
- Now I can simply execute these commands by running - `npm run start` or even `npm start` & `npm run build` (`npm build` doesn't work).

## React Element

- Just like **DOM elements** we have **React elements** in React which is nothing but an **JavaScript Object**.

```javascript
React.createElement("h1", { id: "heading" }, "Hola! Buenos Dias.");
```

- This returns an Object, which is a **React Element** and when we render this React Element, it becomes a **HTML Element**.
- It is often a good practice to keep default text in HTML elements as **"Not Rendered"**. So when we try to render this element and there is any error, we can understand it by seeing **"Not Rendered"** on our web page.
- Creating HTML elements using React Elements as cited above used to be the core of React.
- But we can see here the syntax is large and can get messy as the elements increase.
- To overcome this `JSX` has been introduced.

## JSX

- `JSX` stands for **JavaScript XML**. `JSX` is not a part of React as contrary to what many people assume.
- We can use React for frontend development without using `JSX`. But using `JSX` makes development easy.
- Now to create a `h1` element using `JSX` we can follow the below the syntax.

```javascript
const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">Hola! Buenos Dias.</h1>;
```

- Now to differentiate clearly

```javascript
const heading = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "heading" },
  "Hola! Buenos Dias."
);
//This is how you create a React element using React

const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">Hola! Buenos Dias.</h1>;
//This is how you create a React element using JSX

console.log(heading);
console.log(jsxHeading);
//Both of these log statements give the same output. This is because they are both React Elements, but created using different approaches.
```

### Is jsx valid JavaScript?

- jsx is not pure javascript. JavaScript does not comes with jsx built inside it. The JS engine does not understand jsx.
- JS engine can only understand `ECMAScript`.
- Right now in our case the jsx is still getting executed because of **parcel**.
- The react code that we are writing along with jsx is **transpiled into ECMAScript by parcel**.
- But it should be noted that parcel itself relies on **babel** for this transpilation.
- In brief - `<h1 id="heading">Hola! Buenos Dias.</h1>` is transpiled in to `const heading = React.createElement("h1", { id: "heading" }, "Hola! Buenos Dias.");`. 
- And this `React.createElement` is a **JavaScript Object** and finally this Object is made into `HTMLElement`.

### `class` vs `className` in JSX

- In HTML when we are passing the class attribute, we simply define it as:

```html
<h1 class="heading">This is a heading.</h1>
```

- But in jsx the attribute should be `className`.

```javaScript
<h1 className="heading"> This is a heading.</h1>
```

- This is because, as we are defining, jsx in a javascript file, it will conflict with the `class` keyword of javascript.
- It is not just `className`, all attributes are defined in **camel case** in jsx.
- If jsx needs to be spanned over multiple lines, it should be enclosed in braces `()`. It is not mandatory to enclose if jsx is just in single line.

# React Component

- Class based component
- Functional component

Class based components are relatively old, when compared to functional components.

### React Functional Components

- Always create a functional component with a upper case letter, or else it will create an error. Also, a functional component is a normal JavaScript function that return a `jsx`.

```javascript
const HeadingComponent = () => {
  return <h1 id="heading">Hola! Buenos Dias.</h1>;
};
```

- A functional component can be referred to as a function that returns a React element (as `jsx` will be transpiled as React Element).
- A functional component can't be rendered directly. It follows the below syntax:

```javascript
root.render(<HeadingComponent />);
//OR
root.render(<HeadingComponent> </HeadingComponent>);
```

### General Use cases:

- Component composition:

```javascript
const HeadingComponent = () => {
  return <h1 id="heading">Hola, Buenos Dias!</h1>;
};

const DivComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div id="nested-div">
      <HeadingComponent />
      <p>Como estas?</p>
    </div>
  );
};
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<DivComponent />);
```

- The above case can also be replicated as below:

```javascript
const HeadingComponent = () => {
  return <h1 id="heading">Hola, Buenos Dias!</h1>;
};

const DivComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div id="nested-div">
      {HeadingComponent()}
      <p>Como estas?</p>
    </div>
  );
};
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(DivComponent()); //Simply calling `DivComponent` as it returns "React Element (jsx)". 
```

- A functional component is a JavaScript function at the end of the day. So we can execute it inside the `{}`.

```javascript
<DivComponent />
<DivComponent></DivComponent>
{DivComponent()}
```

- All three are valid!

### Writing JavaScript inside `jsx`

- Use `{}` to write JavaScript in-between.

```javascript
const message = "esta bein?";

const HeadingComponent = () => {
  return <h1 id="heading">Hola, Buenos Dias!</h1>;
};

const DivComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div id="nested-div">
      <HeadingComponent />
      <p>Como estas? {message}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<DivComponent />);
```

- If we want to use `jsx` variable instead of a Functional Component we can also do that

```javascript
const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">Hola, Buenos Dias!</h1>;

const DivComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div id="nested-div">
      {jsxHeading}
      <p>Como estas?</p>
    </div>
  );
};
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<DivComponent />);
```

- Lets assume a scenario, where we are fetching some data from an API.

```javascript
const data = api.data();

const Comp = () => {
  return <div>{data}</div>;
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<Comp />);
```

- This `data` can be malicious, can be like a dangerous JavaScript code which we don't want to run in our local.
- This is called **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**.
- The benefit of using `jsx` is it sanitizes the data before running it.
