- `npx parcel index.html`, this is the command that we have seen before that is used to get the development build.
- Instead of using this command all the time, we can set up `npm script` in `package.json`.
- We can do the same to out production build command, `npx parcel build index.html`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html"
  }
}
```

- Here i'm setting the command for **dev build** as `start` and **prod build** as `build`.
- Now I can simply execute these commands by running - `npm run start` or even `npm start` & `npm run build` (`npm build` doesn't work).
