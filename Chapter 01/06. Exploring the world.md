## Network Communication with React

- Up until this point, we have used local restaurant data to render our UI.
- Let's now try to fetch real-time data by making API requests and use the data to render the UI.
- We can do this whole process in two different ways

1. Load the page -> Make the API calls -> Render the UI
2. Load the page -> Initial render of the UI -> Make API calls -> Re-render the UI with data.

- The second approach though it seems complex, it is best when using React as it promotes UX.
- Also as react has very fast renders the two time rendering of UI is faster than normal.
