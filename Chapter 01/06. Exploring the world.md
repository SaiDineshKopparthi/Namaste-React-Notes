## Network Communication with React

- Up until this point, we have used local restaurant data to render our UI.
- Let's now try to fetch real-time data by making API requests and use the data to render the UI.
- We can do this whole process in two different ways

1. Load the page -> Make the API calls -> Render the UI
2. Load the page -> Initial render of the UI -> Make API calls -> Re-render the UI with data.

- The second approach though it seems complex, it is best when using React as it promotes UX.
- Also as react has very fast renders the two time rendering of UI is faster than normal.

## `useEffect`

- `useEffect` is another React hook which is also a regular javascript function.
- It takes two arguments:
  - An arrow function (callback)
  - A dependency array
- To be more clear, if there is **no dependency array passed as argument**, the `useEffect` is called after each render of the component.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component Rendered");
}, []);

console.log("Component is Rendering");
```

- Let's assume inside the `Body` component we have the above piece of code.
- On the console `Component is Rendering` is followed by `Component Rendered`.
- This is because the `useEffect` executes the callback only after the component is rendered.

```
Component is Rendering
Component Rendered
```

- This particular functionality of `useEffect` can be used to fetch data after the component is rendered.
- We can fetch data inside the callback.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);

const fetchData = async () => {
  const data = await fetch(
    "https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=16.544893&lng=81.521241&is-seo-homepage-enabled=true&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING"
  );
  const json = await data.json();
  console.log(json);
};
```

- Here we are trying to make a network request after the component is rendered.
- Even though everything seems perfect, it will give an error.

  ![CORS Error](./Images/CORSError.png)

- One way to resolve this error is using a proxy server.
- Install `express cors axios` in your project and with the combination of these create a proxy server in the root of your project

#### proxy.js

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");
const axios = require("axios");

const app = express();
app.use(cors());

const SWIGGY_HOME_API =
  "https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=16.544893&lng=81.521241&is-seo-homepage-enabled=true&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING";

app.get("/api/swiggy", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(SWIGGY_HOME_API, {
      headers: {
        "User-Agent":
          "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/123.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
        Referer: "https://www.swiggy.com/",
        "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
      },
    });
    res.json(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error while fetching the data from swiggy: ", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Trouble fetching the restaurants data." });
  }
});

const PORT = 5000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Proxy server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

- What is this doing? We are creating a proxy server and using `localhost:5000` to host.
- Now from our frontend we can call the `localhost:5000/api/swiggy` and our proxy server will call the swiggy api.
- Focus must be kept on the headers being passed along with the request.

```javascript
const response = await axios.get(SWIGGY_HOME_API, {
  headers: {
    "User-Agent":
      "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/123.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
    Referer: "https://www.swiggy.com/",
    "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
  },
});
```

- When you add the headers, you are essentially making your **HTTP request** look like itâ€™s coming from a **real browser** (like Chrome or Firefox), instead of a program or bot (like Axios or cURL).
- The `User-Agent` header tells the server **which browser or client** is making the request.
- The `Referer` header tells the server **where the request is coming from**.
- When you set the `Referer` to `https://www.swiggy.com/`, it indicates that the request originated from the **Swiggy homepage** or their official website, making the request look legitimate.
- Additional headers like `Accept-Language` tell the server **what language you prefer** for the response. Setting this to `en-US` (English) or the appropriate language helps the server understand that the request is coming from a real user who expects a response in a human-readable format.

---

- Now after setting up the proxy server we are able to make an API call to swiggy and fetch the restaurants data.
- To access the restaurants data from the response, we have to do a lot of chaining - `json.data.cards[1].card.card.gridElements.infoWithStyle.restaurants`
- This is considered not a good practice. Instead use optional chaining - `json.data?.cards[1]?.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants`

**Note: We can also use CORS proxy. Attach this url `https://corsproxy.io/?` in front of the swiggy api. It should work fine.**

## Shimmer UI

- We can observe right now that before the restaurants data is fetched, there is time where the screen stays blank.
- This is because our `restaurantData` is empty at that time. So instead of returning an empty `restaurantData` array, we can return a **shimmer container**, which will be rendered until `restaurantData` is filled with data.

```javascript
if (restaurantData.length === 0) {
  return <Shimmer />;
}

return <div className="body"></div>;
```

- This is called conditional rendering. This can be further simplified with a ternary operator:

```javascript
return restaurantData.length === 0 ? <Shimmer /> : <div className="body"></div>;
```

## Understanding why state management through `useState` is important

- Let's add a new button in `Header` component.
- The button's text is created as regular javascript variable and onclick the variable is being updated.
- This approach changes the value of variable, but the UI will not be updated.

```javascript
import { LOGO_URL } from "../utils/constant";

export default Header = () => {
  let loginBTN = "Login";

  return (
    <div className="header">
      <div>
        <img
          className="logo"
          src={LOGO_URL}
          alt="The logo of the food delivery app"
        />
      </div>
      <div className="nav-items">
        <ul>
          <li>Home</li>
          <li>About</li>
          <li>Contact</li>
          <li>Cart</li>
          <li>
            <button
              onClick={() => {
                loginBTN = "Logout";
              }}
              className="login-logout"
            >
              {loginBTN}
            </button>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

- To overcome this `useState()` is used.

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";

import { LOGO_URL } from "../utils/constant";

export default Header = () => {
  const [loginBTN, setLoginBTN] = useState("Login");

  return (
    <div className="header">
      <div>
        <img
          className="logo"
          src={LOGO_URL}
          alt="The logo of the food delivery app"
        />
      </div>
      <div className="nav-items">
        <ul>
          <li>Home</li>
          <li>About</li>
          <li>Contact</li>
          <li>Cart</li>
          <li>
            <button
              onClick={() => {
                setLoginBTN("Logout");
              }}
            >
              {loginBTN}
            </button>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

- Now every time we click on the login button the entire `Header` component is rendered.

**Note: Whenever state variable updates, React triggers a reconciliation cycle (Re-renders the whole component)**

### Filtering restaurants

- Let's implement a search functionality in the app.
- As search text will be dynamic, it should be ideal to store it in a state variable.

```javascript
const [searchText, setSearchText] = useState("");
```

- Now this value needs to be captured from the input filed and updated.

```javascript
<input
  type="text"
  className="search-box"
  value={searchText}
  onChange={(e) => setSearchText(e.target.value)}
/>
<button
  onClick={() => {
    const searchedRestaurants = restaurantData.filter((restaurant) =>
      restaurant.info.name
        .toLowerCase()
        .includes(searchText.toLowerCase())
    );
    setRestaurantData(searchedRestaurants);
  }}
>
  Search
</button>
```

- Now this functionality works good, but there is a bug.
- Every time a user enters a text and clicks on search, the entire `restaurantData` is being updated with only the filtered restaurants.
- After this if the user cannot access the entire restaurants data
- To avoid this we create a new state variable that holds the filtered data.

```javascript
const [filteredRestaurantData, setFilteredRestaurantData] = useState([]);
```

- This variable will be updated along with the `restaurantData` inside the `useEffect`.
- Also we will use this data to render the restaurants inside the `res-container`.

```javascript
<div className="res-container">
  {filteredRestaurantData.map((restaurant) => {
    return (
      <RestaurantCard key={restaurant.info.id} resData={restaurant.info} />
    );
  })}
</div>
```

- Now the `restaurantData` is only used to store the entire data and filter whenever needed.
- This means we will use `setRestaurantData` only once inside the entire `Body` component. This prompts us to change this state variable to regular global variable and update once the API data is fetched.

```javascript
//const [restaurantData, setRestaurantData] = useState([]);
let restaurantData = [];
```

- Update this variable inside the `useEffect`.

```javascript
// setRestaurantData(
//   json.data?.cards[1]?.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants
// );
restaurantData =
  json.data?.cards[1]?.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants;
```

- But this doesn't work as after the `useEffect` is executed the `Body` component is re-rendered and the `restaurantData` is again initialed to an empty array.
- That is the reason why using state variables is important.
