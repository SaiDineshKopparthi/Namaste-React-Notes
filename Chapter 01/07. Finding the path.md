## Use cases with the dependency array from `useEffect`

1. If no dependency array is passed as argument into `useEffect`, the callback will be executed after each render of the component.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("No dependency array");
});
```

2. If the dependency array is empty, then the callback is executed only on the initial render.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Empty dependency array");
}, []);
```

3. If we pass a variable inside the dependency array, the callback is executed every time the value of the variable is changed. In the below case, the callback will be executed every time the `loginBTN` value is changed.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Dependency array with some value inside");
}, [loginBTN]);
```

## React Router

- Before we start creating router we need to create a routing configuration.
- Configuration is a piece of information that will define what will happen on a specific route.
- We will also use a `RouterProvider` which will be used together with routing configuration to render the React app.

#### ./App.js

```javascript
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";

const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout />,
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    element: <About />,
  },
]);

root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />);
```

- So far with these implementations, we are handling default route `("/")` and about route `(/about)`.
- If the user tries to access some random route like `("/zomato")`, as we are not defining any route handler, `react-router-dom` gives a **404 error page by default**.
- But we can also create our custom behavior using `errorElement`.

#### ./App.js

```javascript
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout />,
    errorElement: <ErrorPage />,
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    element: <About />,
  },
  {
    path: "/contact",
    element: <Contact />,
  },
]);
```

- Every time someone enters a wrong route, the `Errorpage` component will be rendered.

### `useRouteError`

- `useRouteError` is an hook given by `react-router-dom`. It will have detailed information about any errors while routing.

#### ./src/components/ErrorPage.js

```javascript
import { useRouteError } from "react-router-dom";

export default ErrorPage = () => {
  const err = useRouteError();
  console.log(err);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>OOPS!!</h1>
      <h2>
        {err.status} - {err.statusText}
      </h2>
      <h2>Something went wrong.</h2>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Children Routes

- Right now, when we are navigating to `/about` or `/contact` route, we are replacing the entire `<AppLayout />`.
- It would be better to keep the `<Header />` intact and replace `<Body />` with `<About />` or `<Contact />`.

#### ./App.js

```javascript
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout />,
    children: [
      {
        path: "/",
        element: <Body />,
      },
      {
        path: "/about",
        element: <About />,
      },
      {
        path: "/contact",
        element: <Contact />,
      },
    ],
    errorElement: <ErrorPage />,
  },
]);
```

- The router configuration is updated with Body, About and Contact as children to AppLayout.
- The `<Outlet />` based on the route path will render the appropriate child.

#### ./App.js

```javascript
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

const AppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <div id="app">
      <Header />
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
};
```

- Now let's try to link options in header to appropriate routes.
- We can simple use anchor tag and link to appropriate route

#### /components/Header.js

```javascript
<li>
  <a href="/about">About</a>
</li>
```

- But when we use this approach, the whole page is re-loaded when navigating.
- To make navigation more efficient, we can use `Link` tag from `react-router-dom`.

```javascript
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
```

```javascript
<li>
  <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
</li>
```

- Now when we click on Contact, instead of re-loading the whole page, react only renders the `Contact` component.

```javascript
<a href="/about">About</a>
<Link to="/contact">About</Link>
```

- This rendering of components without the need to re-load the whole page is why React apps are called Single Page Applications.

## Types of routing

1. Server side routing
2. Client side routing

### Server side routing

Let's say you are in `index.html` and try to navigate to `about.html`. You click on the link, the pages get reloaded, a network call to fetch the `about.html` is made and the new `about.html` is displayed on browser. This is server side routing.

### Client side routing

Now given the same scenario as above, if you want to navigate in-between different components of an application, no network calls will be made, as all the components are already sent with the initial network call.

## Dynamic route

```javascript
{
  path: "/restaurant/:resId",
  element: <RestaurantMenu />,
},
```

- `:resId` is the id of the restaurant.

#### How this works?

- User clicks on any restaurant and the id of that restaurant should be passed as an parameter in the route.
- Now the appropriate `RestaurantMenu` component will be rendered with the respective details of the restaurant based on it's id.

#### How the id is captured inside the `RestaurantMenu`?

- We will use the `useParams` from `react-router-dom`.

```javascript
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

export default RestaurantMenu = () => {
  const { resId } = useParams();
};
```
