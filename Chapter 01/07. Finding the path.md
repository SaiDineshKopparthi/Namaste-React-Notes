### Use cases with the dependency array from `useEffect`

1. If no dependency array is passed as argument into `useEffect`, the callback will be executed after each render of the component.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("No dependency array");
});
```

2. If the dependency array is empty, then the callback is executed only on the initial render.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Empty dependency array");
}, []);
```

3. If we pass a variable inside the dependency array, the callback is executed every time the value of the variable is changed. In the below case, the callback will be executed every time the `loginBTN` value is changed.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Dependency array with some value inside");
}, [loginBTN]);
```
