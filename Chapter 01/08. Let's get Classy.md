## Class Components

- Below is the implementation of `User` component in functional way

```javascript
const User = () => {
  return (
    <div className="user-card">
      <h2>Name: Dinesh Kopparthi</h2>
    </div>
  );
};

export default User;
```

- Now implementing the same component as a class based component.

```javascript
import React from "react";

class User extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="user-card">
        <h2>Name: Dinesh Kopparthi</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default User;
```

### Passing the props in a class component

- For a regular functional component, passing and using props is as shown below:

```javascript
<User name={"Dinesh (from function)"} />
```

```javascript
const User = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <div className="user-card">
      <h2>Name: {name}</h2>
    </div>
  );
};

export default User;
```

- For a class based component props can be passed and received as shown below:

```javascript
<User name={"Dinesh (from class)"} />
```

```javascript
import React from "react";

class User extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="user-card">
        <h2>Name: {this.props.name}</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default User;
```

#### super(props)

- In a **React class component**, if you define a `constructor`, you must call `super()` first before using `this`.

- `super(props)` specifically passes the `props` to the parent class `(React.Component)`.

- Why? Because `React.Component` needs the props to properly set up `this.props` inside your component.

- Without `super(props)`, `this.props` inside the constructor would be `undefined`.

- We can also do, but we could not access `this.props` early (e.g., in the constructor itself).

```javascript
constructor(props) {
    super();
    console.log(this.props); //outputs undefined
  }
```

### State Management in Class Components

- So far we know that for state management in functional components, we can use `useState` hook.
- Hooks are relatively new concepts, which were not available at the time of class components usage.
- Now to create the state variable, we will be doing that inside the `constructor` of the component

```javascript
constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
        count: 10,
        occupation: "SDE",
    }
}
```

- Here we have two state variables, `count` that has a initial value of `10` and `occupation` that has a initial value as string `"SDE"`.
- Using these variables is pretty straight forward:

```javascript
<div className="user-card">
  <h2>Name: {name}</h2>
  <h3>Location: Missouri</h3>
  <h4>Contact: @dinesh</h4>
  <h4>Occupation: {this.state.occupation}</h4>
  <h4>Has ordered {this.state.count} times</h4>
</div>
```

### Updating state variables in class components

- We should never update state variable directly.

```javascript
<button
  onClick={() => {
    this.state.count = this.state.count + 1;
  }}
>
  New Order
</button>
```

- The correct way to update is as below using `this.setState()` which is given access by the react.

```javascript
<button
  onClick={() => {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1,
    });
  }}
>
  New Order
</button>
```

- It should also be noted that, even though we have two variables inside `this.state`, only `count` will be updated according to our code and nothing's going to happen to `occupation`.
