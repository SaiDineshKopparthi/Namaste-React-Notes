### <div align="center">Everything that we can do using `REACT`, can be done using regular `HTML` & `JavaScript`.</div>

## <div align="center">THEN WHY REACT?</div>

- Not just react, the reason we use any frameworks/libraries is because it improve developers experience.

## Cleaning the `app`

- So far we have included all the components inside the `app.js` file. In a real-time case we have a lot of components and this will make the `aap.js` a whole lot messy.
- To resolve this we can create individual files for each component.
- Now when we create the component files the extension can be `.js` or `.jsx` or `.tsx` if in TypeScript. It doesn't matter what file type it is.

## Importing and Exporting files.

- Now that we have successfully isolated components into separate files into different folder, to be able to use these `components` inside `app.js` we should `export` them from their files and `import` them into `app.js`

#### /src/components/Header.js

```javascript
export default Header = () => {
  return <div className="header"></div>;
};
```

#### /src/app.js

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import Header from "./Components/Header";
//import Header from "./Components/Header.js"; We can ignore the file extension after "Header" and it would still work.

const AppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <div id="app">
      <Header />
    </div>
  );
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(<AppLayout />);
```

## Cleaning the `app` cont'd.

- It is not a good practice to keep constant values in component files, for eg: media-urls, json hard coded values.
- One of the best practice is to create a separate folder - utils.

#### src/utils/constant.js

```javascript
export const MEDIA_ASSETS_URL =
  "https://media-assets.swiggy.com/swiggy/image/upload/fl_lossy,f_auto,q_auto,w_660/";
export const LOGO_URL =
  "https://marketplace.canva.com/EAGXsRURT9o/1/0/1200w/canva-yellow-and-brown-kitchen-food-logo-DRT6KFcL0ts.png";
```

- As you can see here instead of regular **default import** we are using **named export** as we have to export multiple values from the same file.

#### src/components/RestaurantCard.js

```javascript
import { MEDIA_ASSETS_URL } from "../utils/constant";
```

#### src/components/Header.js

```javascript
import { LOGO_URL } from "../utils/constant";
```
