### <div align="center">Everything that we can do using `REACT`, can be done using regular `HTML` & `JavaScript`.</div>

## <div align="center">THEN WHY REACT?</div>

- Not just react, the reason we use any frameworks/libraries is because it improve developers experience.

## Cleaning the `app`

- So far we have included all the components inside the `app.js` file. In a real-time case we have a lot of components and this will make the `aap.js` a whole lot messy.
- To resolve this we can create individual files for each component.
- Now when we create the component files the extension can be `.js` or `.jsx` or `.tsx` if in TypeScript. It doesn't matter what file type it is.

## Importing and Exporting files.

- Now that we have successfully isolated components into separate files into different folder, to be able to use these `components` inside `app.js` we should `export` them from their files and `import` them `app.js`

#### /src/components/Header.js

```javascript
export default Header = () => {
  return <div className="header"></div>;
};
```

#### /src/app.js

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import bhimavaramResData from "../bhimavaramRestaurants.json";
import Header from "./Components/Header";
//import Header from "./Components/Header.js"; We can ignore the file extension after "Header" and it would still work.

const AppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <div id="app">
      <Header />
    </div>
  );
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(<AppLayout />);
```
